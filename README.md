# The Microservices Project

This repo contains a simple microservice architecture, written in Java and using the Spring framework.

__As this project is currently being worked on, further documentation will follow, once all MVP features have been added.__

In the meantime, please feel free to explore the code or view my other projects, all of which will provide more details - for example:
1. [The Recipes Project @ Practice-Recipes-DB](https://github.com/kimgoetzke/Practice-Recipes-DB) (A simple multi-users web service, written in Java and using the Spring framework)
2. [Basic CI Project @ Practice-Basic-CI](https://github.com/kimgoetzke/Practice-Basic-CI) (A continuous integration pipeline using GitHub Actions, Gradle, Docker for Java applications)
3. [Muffin @ Concept-Muffin](https://github.com/kimgoetzke/Concept-Muffin) (The concept for a desktop game written in C#)
